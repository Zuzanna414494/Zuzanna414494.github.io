#  About me - Zuzanna Konopka

## 1. Education

* I am currently studying Computer Science and Intelligent Systems at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Automatics, Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w.

## 2. My knowledge and skills
* My professional interests focus on data analysis and processing, as well as database administration. As part of my engineering work, I focus on reviewing methods of numerical data augmentation and analyzing their impact on classification quality.

## 3. Hobby

* I have loved physics since high school. My favorite subjects are: mechanics, dynamics, and quantum physics. I won't say I don't love astronomy. I have a whole folder of photos of the Moon in each of its phases. Looking at the stars at night and telling interesting physics facts fills me with pride!
* I also love running and cycling. This is my time to relax from the outside world. Everyone needs an hour or a half of downtime, even me, who is a very sociable person and loves being with friends. I started running 4 years ago, my bike has been with me since birth. My dream is to take part in a marathon someday!!!


## 4. A little something about me

* I am Zuzanna, a very open-minded woman who needs people around her. I am very interested in people, and working with them is pure pleasure!
* Coffee and cats are inseparable aspects of my life! These beautiful, charming animals brighten up every rainy day. And coffee not only gives me energy, but is also a great excuse to meet!
* I am also a Christian. I belong to the Dominican community Beczka in Krakow. Faith in my life has always been, is and will be forever.
